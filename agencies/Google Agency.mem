They can engage in interactive, back-and-forth conversations, retaining memory and context for future responses. GPT-4o, being a successor to GPT-4, has several improvements over its predecessor, including multimodal capabilities (handling of multiple data types like text, images, and audio), performance and efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and extended language support. However, GPT-4 might be preferred in some business contexts due to its proven stability and familiarity. It also should be noted that despite improved functionalities, GPT-4o had faced some controversies."}}
